# Income Data Classification using Decision Trees

## Goal

To predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data using Decision tree developed from scratch and off-the-shelf classifier.

## Steps

a) Implement the ID3 decision tree learning algorithm

b) Run the decision tree construction algorithm on the training examples. Compute the accuracy on validation examples and testing examples.

c) Run the off-the-shelf Decision tree classifier. Compute the training and testing accuracy.
